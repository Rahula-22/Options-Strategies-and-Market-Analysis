# Project overview 
This project delves into the sophisticated world of option derivatives and their myriad strategies. We meticulously applied the Binomial Model, Black-Scholes-Merton, and Monte Carlo methods to accurately value options, guiding financial decision-making processes with precision.

Harnessing the power of the GARCH Model, we forecasted market volatility, utilizing advanced option strategies such as Max Pain, Iron Condor, Straddle, Butterfly, and Spreads. Our approach leveraged critical option Greeks (𝛿, θ, γ) to optimize risk management and enhance strategic outcomes.

A standout feature of this project is the development of a cutting-edge option strategy platform using ReactJS. This platform empowers users to craft, visualize, and execute both standard and bespoke option trading strategies. We integrated dynamic payoff charts, enabling comprehensive risk analysis and precise evaluation of profit and loss scenarios.
